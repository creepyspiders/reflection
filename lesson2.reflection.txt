How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

It offers flexibility whether you want to store the status of 1 fils or multiple files. in case you are working on a large project contains 100 files, when you make a few changes to some of the file, you can just commit these files instead of 
the whole repository
