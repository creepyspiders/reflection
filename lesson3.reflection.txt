How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 
one commit per logical change?

the staging area is a buffer area between working 
directory and the commit area. the commit is meant
for per logical change, but in the meantime, you will
still need to store you small changes in order to finish
the logical change. the staging area is for you to store
all the small changes and once the logical change is 
achieved, you can then move all the staging area to 
a fomal commit area where all other people can see and 
understand you code.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

the branches are helpful when you wanna experiment an 
feature while this feature is away from the official goal
if you do it in you official master branch, you will mess
up the history of the development thus make it difficult 
for other people to understand. branch enable you make another
version of the program while keeping the original verison.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

it can make me clear when does the program split up. what kind
of features of each branch have or dont have.
