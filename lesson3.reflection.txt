How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 
one commit per logical change?

the staging area is a buffer area between working 
directory and the commit area. the commit is meant
for per logical change, but in the meantime, you will
still need to store you small changes in order to finish
the logical change. the staging area is for you to store
all the small changes and once the logical change is 
achieved, you can then move all the staging area to 
a fomal commit area where all other people can see and 
understand you code.
