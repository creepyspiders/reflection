knowing the differences can make you realize what you have changed
if there is a problem introduced with the into of a new change
you can easily spot out the mistake.
it's also helpful for you to keep track of the old file. maybe the 
old file contains something valuable, with the new change you may 
lost it and never gonna get it back.

knowing the entire history of a file, may make you realize how you 
get where you are today, what kind of mistakes you have made when you 
look back of the history.it also give you confidence that you can 
accomplish so much more with the time passed by.

the pros are the changes are usually logically meaningful.the down turn 
is that is hard to judge when to commit mentally and pysically. 
because sometimes you dont know whether you should commit or not. and some
times you simply forget. 

the reason why git allow multiple files tracking is the nature of coding is 
usually involves making changes to multiple fils in order to achieve one 
logical goal, while in other editors like google docs is usually much more
independent between files. you usually dont have to change all the fils 
simutaneously to acheieve a goal.

how to use commands git diff and git log
you can use git log to view all the commits or histories of your file. 
press q to log out from the history.
press git diff id1 id2 to view the differences. the older id should be the first
git diff older_id newer_id
this will give you the differences between two comments where
red is the deleted comments
green is the new insertion for the comments.

it definitely make me more confident to try some bold ideas, because even 
i messed up the entire code, and it totally cannot run, i still got the 
whole previous version on my back, if the new idea is working, i can just 
commit it. so it will  be very easy to get back in the future.
